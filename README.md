# SRWE
Simple Runtime Window Editor (SRWE) - a program that allows you to pick a running
application and manipulate size, position, styles of its main/child windows.
SRWE was built to maintain games that run in Windowed-mode. For example,
you can get the fullscreen-mode effect on a windowed-mode game or get fullscreen effect
with visible taskbar.
Since SRWE allows you to manually set up any window size or position, it can be useful
in taking high-resolution screenshots in games that support windowed-mode.
